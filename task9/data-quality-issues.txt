1. The vehicle_color attribute of the parking violations and open violations tablesi has many representation for the same color. For example, WHITE and WHT stats for WHITE.
2.vehicle color and vehicle make are bit mixed up. For example - VOLKS and TOYOT occurs in color section while its actually a make.
3.Few values of attributes contain ',' in them. Hence while we split the csv file into words, this will give rise to more words than the actual number of words/attributes in a row of csv file.
4. Values for vehicle_color and vehicle_make are missing.
5. There is a value =99 in state of registration column in parking violations which might correspond to missing value replaced with 99.
6. Few other columns in parking violations like 4 and 8 contains maximum missing values. (missing values are more than available values).Its same with open-violations for column 8 and 9
